# Brickwell Health Simulator Configuration
# =========================================
# This is the main configuration file for the PHI simulator.
# All values can be overridden via environment variables with BRICKWELL_ prefix.

simulation:
  # Simulation starts with ZERO members. The warmup period allows
  # population to build before analysis. Claims require waiting periods
  # to complete (2-12 months), so warmup should be at least 2 years.
  start_date: "2020-01-01"
  end_date: "2022-12-31"  # 3 years for fresh run
  warmup_days: 730        # First 2 years = warmup, remaining 6 = analysis

scale:
  # Target 100k members by end of warmup (2 years)
  # This drives acquisition rate: ~140/day to reach 100k in 730 days
  target_member_count: 1000
  target_growth_rate: 0.03   # 3% annual growth after warmup

      === MEMBER CONTEXT ===
      {member_context}
      
      {prior_surveys_section}
      
      === PATTERN ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS ===
      Analyze the claim_history and current_claim to identify patterns:
      
      1. SAME SERVICE TYPE, DIFFERENT OUTCOME
         - Was this service type previously rejected but now approved? → Positive turnaround, improved sentiment
         - Was this service type previously approved but now rejected? → Negative surprise, worse sentiment
      
      2. REPEATED ISSUES
         - Multiple rejections for same/different services? → Compounding frustration
         - Pattern of slow processing? → Eroding trust
      
      3. SERVICE RECOVERY
         - Did member call to complain? Was it resolved? → Affects sentiment trajectory
      
      4. OVERALL TRAJECTORY
         - Are recent claims better or worse than older claims?
         - Consider billing issues, digital engagement, premium increases
      
      === SCORING GUIDELINES ===
      - Australian health insurance NPS is typically low (industry avg 0-30)
      - Claim rejection is the strongest negative driver (-3 to -5 on NPS)
      - Same type rejection→approval = cautious positive (+2 to +3)
      - Driver scores should correlate with NPS (within ±3 points typically)
      - Detractors (0-6) more likely to consent to follow-up (60%)
